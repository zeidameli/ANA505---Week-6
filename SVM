#We can clearly see from the Histograms of Petal.length 
#and Petal.width that we can clearly seperate out Setosa species with very high confidence.

#However, Versicolor and Virginica Species are overlapped. 
#If we look at the scatterplot of Sepal.Length vs Petal.Length 
#and Petal.Width vs Petal.Length, 
#we can distintly see a seperator that can be draw between the groups of Species.

#Looks like we can just use Petal.Width and Petal.Length as parameters 
#and come with a good model. SVM seems to be a very good model for this type of data.

#from the graph you can see data, support vector(represented by cross sign) 
#and decision boundry, belong to 3 types of species

#White color represented predicted class for second species(versicolor)

#Pink color represented predicted class for third species(virginica)

#Also we have 52 Support vector, 
#8 of them belongs to first species
#(You can see 8 cross in first class), 
#22 of them belongs to second species, 
#21 of them belongs to third species.

#What is the accuracy rate?
# accuracy rate is 97.33% (very high)
